    <p>Our model consisted of two main structure.First structure where we burn plstics in chamber and from there gases and photons are produced then photons are absorebed by solar panel for electricity production. Then gases produced their goes inside second structure which contains alkaline water,copper rod which sereves as cathode,zonc rod which serve as anode and salt bridge then electrochemical reaction takes place between them and gases produced as result of burning.Then we compile electricity produced in both structures and we store it in battery. From there it goes into transforemer which converts drective current into alternative current for easy houseold supply.  </p>
